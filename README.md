# Caffeine-Overflow - GHAR SURAKSHA

Please find the files related to the web dashboard in the master branch and the code to the flutter application in the application branch

To run the web dashboard on your local system, install requirements.txt using pip, and then run app.py. However many functionalities will not work as we use firebase, and the creds cannot be shared. This web application uses flask for its backend. 

sih_construction_progress.ipynb has all the code related to using image processing to find the relative progress in building construction. 

The folder named 'folder' contains the code for a chatbot api that we call 'Suraksha' used in our application. This chatbot is used to answer any general queries related to the project, amd also obtain real-time reports from the database.
