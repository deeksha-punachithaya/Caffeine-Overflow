Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) is an initiative by Government of India in which affordable housing will be provided to the urban poor with a target of building 20 million affordable houses by 31 March 2022.[1][2] It has two components: Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) (PMAY-U) for the urban poor and Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin)[3] (PMAY-G and also PMAY-R) for the rural poor.[4][5] This scheme is converged with other schemes to ensure houses have a toilet, Saubhagya Yojana electricity connection, Ujjwala Yojana LPG gas connection, access to drinking water and Jan Dhan banking facilities, etc.[6] Total 1 cr homes are approved against total demand of 1.12Cr as of 28 December 2019.[7]
Public housing programme in India started with the rehabilitation of refugees immediately after independence. Till 1960, nearly 5 lakh families were provided houses in different parts of northern India. In 1957, within the ambit of the second five-year plan of Prime Minister Nehru,Village Housing Programme (VHP) was introduced providing loans to individuals and cooperatives of up to ₹5,000/- per unit. Only 67,000 houses could be constructed in this scheme till end of the 5 th Five Year Plan (1974-1979). Another scheme introduced in the 4 th Plan called House Sites-cum-Construction Assistance Scheme (HSCAS) was also transferred to the State Sector from 1974-75.[8]
With the launch of Indira Awas Yojana (IAY) by the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1985, the public housing programme in India got a boost. IAY was launched as a rural housing programme targeting SC/ST and Minority population. The programme was gradually extended to cover all Below Poverty Line (BPL) population.[9]
As a part of the continuous efforts of the Indian Government to fulfill the housing needs of rural and urban poor, Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June 2015 with an aim to provide affordable housing .[10][11]
Under PMAY, it is proposed to build 2 crore houses for urban poor including Economically Weaker Sections and Low Income Groups in urban areas by the year 2022 through a financial assistance of ₹2 trillion (US$28 billion) from central government.[4][1][2] This Mission has four components viz., In-situ Slum Redevelopment with private sector participation using land as resource, Affordable Housing through Credit Linked Subsidy, Affordable Housing in Partnership with private and public sector and Beneficiary led house construction/enhancement. Under these components, central assistance will be in the range of ₹1 lakh (US$1,400) to ₹2.30 lakh (US$3,200).[citation needed]
